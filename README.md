# Basic Pygame Project (WIP)

This is a Work-in-Progress basic Pygame project demonstrating how to create a simple game with character movement and a background image I am working on for fun with my daughter.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. Verify by running:
  ```bash
  python --version
```
- **Install Pygames**:
```
pip install pygame
```


### How to Run:
- Create a folder and Use git clone in terminal 
 within created folder, or download directly in GitHub.
```
git clone https://github.com/iNeso1984/Pygame_App.git
```
- Download the Project (if not using Git):
Download the project files (usually a ZIP archive) and extract them to your desired location.

- Run the Script:
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the main Python script:
```
python your_script_name.py
```

### Game Controls:
- **Arrow Keys:** Move the character left, right, up, and down.
- **Spacebar:** Jump.
- **Rename Project:** If desired, rename your script to any name. your_script_name.py is the main Python script containing the game logic.
- **Images:** images/bg_img.jpeg are optional and can be changed out.

Have Fun!
